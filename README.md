# School-Management-Site
Beginning stages of a school management site

This project is written using .NET. It uses Blazor Server, Entity Framework Core, WebAPI and xunit. It also
established some charts using ChartJS.Blazor.Fork, but this will probably change since I've mostly been using 
Plotly for work projects.

It is in an early stage but structure has been established and API can be called for Data Access from a 
Sqlite DB or MariaDB. The Models in the Database project were creating as part of planning and most of 
them are not used for anything yet.

This started as a hobby project and is a very low priority for me, so it will be a while until I come back to it.
